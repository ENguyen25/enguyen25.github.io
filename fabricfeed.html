        <p>FlowerFeed is an online marketplace for florists and farmers of native flowers to connect. I developed the front-end and back-end of the mobile-responsive application using Django, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>

        <p class="content">I entered a 30-day test pilot program with the startup company. My assignment was to build the front-end of the registration page based on the Figma provided by the UX design team. I finished the assignment in 3 weeks instead of the month, and quickly moved on to building the front-end of the marketplace homepage.</p>
        <p class="content">For the marketplace homepage, I refactored the code so that it was mobile-responsive. Before the refactor, the elements were squished together and did not scale on mobile-view. I added a mobile sidebar for when the screen size is 900px that could be toggled with a hamburger menu. I also added a modal popup of the company profile when you click the company name on an item listing. I edited the UX of the listings to match the new design.</p>
        <p class="content">After the design was made for the sign-in page, I developed the sign-in page with CSS and JavaScript. Starting from mobile-view, I progressively made it responsive to larger devices.</p>
        <p class="content">Then I built the chat functionality using Django channels and WebSocket. I built the models for chat messages, chatrooms, and connection requests. I built the front-end for the messaging portion, so that users can send a message to any company they want and start chatting.</p>
