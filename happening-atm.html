        <p>City council agenda app that allows meeting participants to "subscribe" to meeting items for notifications via text or email. Participants will benefit greatly from a notification system rather than be on stand-by for an undetermined length of time.</p>

        <p class="content">I took on a role as project manager for the Happening ATM project with Code for San Jose. I managed a team of 3 developers and 2 UX designers. Under my leadership, we did a revamp of the application design, allowed people to edit their profile, and enabled status change functionality for the meeting agendas.</p>
        <p class="content">I also did work on the front-end development of the application. I used SCSS and React to the color scheme and layout of the sign-in page, the Home page, FAQ page, Profile page, About page, header, and footer to match the updated designs from the UX design team. I updated the user interface of the "Create New Meeting" modal to allow people to enter a link to a meeting URL, and changed the colors and layout. I enabled the functionality to update the account email and phone number with PostgreSQL.</p>
